<a name="Introduction">INTRODUCTION</a>
<p>The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.<br>
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, NOT by bacteria.<br>
The virus that causes COVID-19 is in a family of viruses called Coronaviridae.<br>
Antibiotics do not work against viruses. Some people who become ill with COVID-19 can also develop a
bacterial infection as a complication. <br>
In this case, antibiotics may be recommended by a health care provider. <br>
There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19. <br>
If you have symptoms, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for assistance.<br>

Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor
or health facility.
People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.
On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show,
however it can take up to 14 days.<br><br>

Keep a safe distance
To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
Stay home if you feel unwell.
If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This
protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
Masks
Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks
alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand
hygiene.
Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.

<p>Self-care
If you feel sick you should rest, drink plenty of fluid, and eat nutritious food. Stay in a separate room
from other family members, and use a dedicated bathroom if possible. Clean and disinfect frequently
touched surfaces.

Everyone should keep a healthy lifestyle at home. Maintain a healthy diet, sleep, stay active, and make
social contact with loved ones through the phone or internet. Children need extra love and attention
from adults during difficult times. Keep to regular routines and schedules as much as possible.
It is normal to feel sad, stressed, or confused during a crisis. Talking to people you trust, such as friends
and family, can help. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to a health worker or counsellor.

WHO and its partners are committed to accelerating the development of a COVID-19 vaccine while
maintaining the highest standards on safety.

In the past, vaccines have been developed through a series of steps that can take many years. Now,
given the urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine, unprecedented financial investments and scientific
collaborations are changing how vaccines are developed. This means that some of the steps in the
research and development process are happening in parallel, while still maintaining strict clinical and
safety standards. For example, some clinical trials are evaluating multiple vaccines at the same time.
However, this does not make the studies any less rigorous.
